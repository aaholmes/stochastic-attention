# Semi-Stochastic Sparse Attention

When a large language model (LLM) generates text, each new token attends to every earlier token. To do that, the GPU re-reads a stored key and value vector for every past position (the KV cache) from its main memory (HBM, high-bandwidth memory). At decode time that memory traffic, not arithmetic, limits speed. This repository tests whether attention can instead be **estimated by randomly sampling a small part of the cache**, in a way that is unbiased: the expected output equals exact attention.

I built this as a research prototype. It reproduces the sampled-attention estimator from *Stochastic Sparse Attention for Memory-Bound Inference* ([arXiv:2605.01910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.01910), whose authors call the method SANTA) in plain PyTorch, then tests several extensions of it inside a real model, Qwen3-4B. All 98 tests run on CPU without downloading a model (`uv run pytest`).

## Summary of results

- **Plain sampling works well.** Systematic sampling (`santa_sys`) matches dense perplexity to within +0.19% (s.d. 0.06% over 3 seeds) while reading 3.5% of cached values, about 28× fewer. That was measured on Qwen3-4B, WikiText-103, at 4096-token context over 8 chunks.
- **Computing the heaviest tokens exactly does not save reads.** The hybrid estimator, which computes the top-weighted tokens exactly and samples the rest, has much lower variance per sample. It ties plain sampling once you count *distinct* values read, because repeated draws of the few hot tokens cost plain sampling nothing extra.
- **Reading contiguous blocks costs more.** Block sampling stays unbiased, but at a fixed read budget its variance grows with block size on unstructured attention.
- **Skipping key reads by cluster selection fails in the version tested.** Deterministically keeping the top key clusters needs about 60% of keys to preserve perplexity, because attention's long tail of small weights carries too much total mass to drop.
- **Sampling bias exists, and a small adapter does not remove it.** Averaged over draws, sampled attention still shifts the next-token distribution. This systematic bias is 74% of the per-draw error at 8 samples. A rank-16 low-rank adapter (LoRA) trained to reduce it removes at most 8%.

## Background

Attention at one decode step is a weighted average of the cached value vectors. The weights `A` come from a softmax, so they are non-negative and sum to 1, which makes attention an expectation over a probability distribution. An expectation can be estimated by Monte Carlo: draw `S` value rows with probability `A` and average them. The estimate is unbiased, and its variance falls as roughly `1/S`, or faster with structured sampling. The cost that matters is how many distinct value rows are fetched from memory.

## Estimators

`attn(q, K, V, impl=...)` exposes one interface with these implementations:

| `impl` | what it does | unbiased |
|---|---|---|
| `dense` | exact attention (reference) | — |
| `topk` | keeps the `k` highest-weight tokens, renormalizes | no |
| `santa` | `S` independent draws from `A` | yes |
| `santa_strat` | stratified: one draw from each of `S` equal-mass strata | yes |
| `santa_sys` | systematic: one random offset, `S` evenly spaced draws | yes |
| `santa_hybrid` | top-`k_h` tokens exact, remaining mass sampled | yes |
| `santa_block` | samples contiguous blocks of `B` rows | yes |
| `skip_k` | reads only the key clusters ranked highest by a cheap estimate | no |

The measurement harness accumulates in float64, so low-precision roundoff is never mistaken for bias. Every result file in `src/ssa/results/` records the git commit, GPU, and library versions that produced it.

## Results

### Unbiasedness and variance on synthetic attention

Every unbiased estimator's Monte Carlo mean matches `dense` within sampling error (largest |z| = 2.4 over all output entries at S=64). Variance falls with sample count `S` with fitted log-log slopes of −1.00 for `santa`, −1.34 for `santa_strat`, and −1.49 for `santa_sys` (S = 8–256, 400 runs, 256 keys). These reproduce the paper's finding that structured sampling beats independent draws.

![Variance vs total sample budget](docs/variance_convergence.png)

For the hybrid, the budget on the x-axis counts both the exact head and the sampled tail (`k_h + S_tail`). At equal total budget, the hybrid's variance is 3.6–6.4× lower than `santa_sys` with `k_h = 4`, and 11–33× lower with `k_h = 16` (budgets 32–256; 800 runs, 256 keys, query scale 4). These synthetic-tensor numbers are single fits with no interval computed.

### Real-model perplexity

The estimators replace attention inside Qwen3-4B (in BF16, the 16-bit brain floating-point format) during decode, while the prompt is still processed exactly. The model runs on a from-scratch Qwen3 inference engine I wrote separately ([github.com/aaholmes/llms](https://github.com/aaholmes/llms)); a small hook in that engine lets this package swap the decode attention op. `ssa.harness.ppl_sweep` scores teacher-forced perplexity as a function of the fraction of value rows read.

![Perplexity vs value-read fraction at 4096 context](docs/ppl_frontier_4096.png)

- `santa_sys` with S=512 reads 3.5% of value rows and raises perplexity by +0.19% (s.d. 0.06%, 3 seeds, 8 chunks of 4096 tokens). At fixed S the read fraction falls as context grows: at S=256 it is 3.8% at 2048 tokens and 2.2% at 4096.
- The hybrid ties `santa_sys` on reads. `santa_hybrid(k_h=16, S=48)` reads 2.0% for +0.62% (s.d. 0.03%), while `santa_sys` at S=256 reads 2.2% for +0.46% (s.d. 0.05%). The hybrids with large heads reach +0.1% but read 7–8% of rows to do it.
- The mechanism is collisions. Attention in Qwen3-4B concentrates on few tokens: the participation ratio `1/Σ A²`, the effective number of tokens carrying the weight, averages 14.5 out of 1536 cached tokens (2048-token context, all layers and heads). Sampling with replacement therefore draws the few hot tokens repeatedly, and a GPU cache serves those repeats without another memory read. That cancels the hybrid's variance advantage once reads are counted. A synthetic sweep over concentration (`ssa.harness.crossover`, participation ratio 10 to 493) found no setting where the hybrid reads meaningfully less for equal variance.
- `topk` is biased and behaves erratically. At 2048 context, k=1 gives perplexity 820 compared with 13.1 for dense, while for k ≥ 16 it scores *below* dense ([figure](docs/ppl_frontier_cheap2k.png)). Truncating the tail changes the model rather than approximating it, so it is not a like-for-like comparison with the unbiased methods.

### Contiguous-block sampling

`santa_block` is unbiased for every block size B (B = 1 reduces to `santa`; B ≥ number of keys reduces to `dense`). On synthetic attention at a fixed budget of 128 reads out of 512 keys, larger blocks give both higher variance and a larger distinct-read fraction (5.8% at B=1, 25% at B=128), because each sampled block spends reads on its cold rows and defeats the collision savings above.

![Variance vs block size](docs/variance_vs_block.png)

Blocks would only pay off if attention mass clustered in contiguous positions, or if contiguous reads were enough cheaper per byte on the hardware; this byte-count harness measures neither. `ssa.harness.plot_blocks` also tests one proposed fix: reorder the cache so each block holds keys with similar content (k-means on the keys). Block sampling stays unbiased under any reordering. The figure above predates that option, so it shows the native order only.

### Skipping key reads

Sampling saves value reads, but computing the weights `A` still reads every key. I tested whether cheap per-cluster summaries could decide which key clusters to read at all.

A diagnostic on real Qwen3-4B keys (`ssa.harness.cluster_diag`) found two things. Estimating a cluster's total attention weight from its mean and covariance fails, because the weight inside each cluster sits on a single token (within-cluster participation ratio ≈ 1). A *magnitude* estimate ranks better. It clusters keys by direction and keeps each key's true length. With 8-key clusters at the two deepest layers sampled (24 and 35), it captures 99% of the attention weight while reading 0.24–0.32% of keys, compared with a best possible 0.19–0.26%; the Gaussian estimate needs 22–35%. With 16-key clusters it does much worse (8–12% of keys). Setting: one KV head, 1024-token prompt, 32 decode steps, layers 0, 12, 24, 35.

End to end, the ranking was not enough. With `skip_k`, which reads only the top-ranked clusters and drops the rest, perplexity is +1.4% at 60% of keys read and +92% at 17% (640-token context, 2 chunks, 1 seed). With `santa_sys` at S=256, 9.2% of rows are read and perplexity is within 1% of dense. Dropping clusters discards the long tail of small attention weights, and that tail matters in aggregate; sampling covers it cheaply. Two variants remain untested: selecting clusters to a fixed key budget, and an unbiased version that samples the unselected clusters rather than dropping them.

**The magnitude estimate and its bounds.** Write each key as length times direction, `k_j = |k_j| k̂_j`, so the exact term is `e^{q·k_j} = e^{|k_j|(q·k̂_j)}`. The estimate keeps each key's true length but replaces its direction with the cluster's mean direction `ĉ_b`:

```
m̂_b = Σ_{j∈b} e^{|k_j|(q·ĉ_b)}    estimates    m_b = Σ_{j∈b} e^{|k_j|(q·k̂_j)}
```

It is exact when all keys in the cluster point in one direction. The exponent error is `|k_j| q·(k̂_j − ĉ_b)`, which the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality bounds by `|k_j| ‖q‖ ρ_b`, where `ρ_b = max_{j∈b} ‖k̂_j − ĉ_b‖` is the cluster's angular radius. That gives rigorous bounds:

```
Σ_j e^{|k_j|[(q·ĉ_b) − ‖q‖ρ_b]}  ≤  m_b  ≤  Σ_j e^{|k_j|[(q·ĉ_b) + ‖q‖ρ_b]}
```

`m̂_b` is the centre of this band and is what clusters are ranked by. The upper bound supports a guarantee: a cluster whose upper bound falls below the best score found so far cannot hold the top token, so a branch-and-bound search that skips only such clusters never misses it. Because it uses each key's exact length and bounds only the direction, it is tighter than the simpler bound `|b| e^{q·c_b + ‖q‖R_b}` built from the cluster's Euclidean radius `R_b`.

### Bias of sampled decoding

Each sampled step is unbiased, but the model feeds that step through nonlinear layers, so the expected next-token distribution still differs from the dense one (a Jensen gap). `ssa.harness.bias_isolate` separates this systematic bias from per-draw noise by averaging 32 draws per step. It measures both as total variation distance (TVD) from the dense model's next-token distribution. Setting: Qwen3-4B, code corpus, 2040 decode steps.

![Bias and variance vs S](src/ssa/results/bias_split_plot.png)

| S | bias (TVD) | bias share of per-draw error | bias with LoRA |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 0.062 | 74% | 0.059 |
| 16 | 0.026 | 58% | 0.024 |
| 32 | 0.011 | 42% | 0.011 |
| 64 | 0.0056 | 36% | 0.0054 |

The bias falls roughly as `1/S` (fitted exponent −1.16) and dominates the per-draw error at low S. A rank-16 LoRA adapter trained per S to reduce TVD (`ssa.harness.debias_train`) removes 0–8% of it. Training on the multi-draw average instead, which targets bias directly, does no better (S=16: 0.025; S=32: 0.011). On WikiText-103 at S=32 the bias is 0.034 and the adapter lowers it to 0.033. These runs saved only per-S averages, not per-step values, so no intervals are available.

## Not yet built

- Reusing samples across decode steps, reweighted by an importance ratio, and skipping reads for blocks still in the GPU's L2 cache.
- Sharing one sample set across attention heads.
- Larger per-token value vectors, of which only a sampled slice is ever read.

## Glossary

- **Participation ratio** — `1/Σ p²`, the effective number of items carrying a distribution's mass.
- **Partition function / free energy** — softmax weights have the Boltzmann form `p_i ∝ e^{q·k_i}`; a cluster's summed weight is its partition function `Z_b`, and `log Z_b` is its free energy.
- **Jensen gap** — the difference `E[f(X)] − f(E[X])` for a nonlinear `f`; why unbiased attention outputs can still bias the model's output.
- **Importance sampling** — drawing from a convenient distribution and reweighting by true/proposal probability to stay unbiased.
- **Rao–Blackwellization / control variate** — replacing part of a random estimate by its exact value to reduce variance; the hybrid's exact head does this.
- **Stratified / systematic sampling** — splitting the distribution into `S` equal-mass strata and drawing once per stratum, independently (stratified) or with one shared offset (systematic).
- **Maximum inner product search (MIPS)** — finding the keys with the largest `q·k`.
- **Branch and bound** — a search that discards regions whose bound shows they cannot contain the best answer.
- **LoRA (low-rank adaptation)** — fine-tuning by adding small trainable low-rank matrices to frozen weights.
- **TVD (total variation distance)** — half the L1 distance between two probability distributions.
- **Prior art that selects keys with a bias** — Reformer (hashes keys into buckets), Routing Transformer (k-means clusters of keys), and Quest/ClusterKV (select cache blocks by representative vectors). All select deterministically, unlike the unbiased sampling here.
